- Task 0
Constant Time — O(1)
An algorithm is said to have a constant time when it is not dependent on the input data (n). 
No matter the size of the input data, the running time will always be the same


- Task 1
Time Complexity - O(n)
Linear Time — O(n) complexity observed during the execution of the task 1 as eventhough
it has two for loop that dependent on input, each one interating from 1 to n this resutls input
O(2n) which the time complexity as O(n)

# Time analysis
# 
# Our above code with dictionay access is simple array data structure access and according to 
# https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/ & udacity lesson explain Big(O) we observe below
# The get_senders_num_list has, get_caller_receivers_num_list and get_markts_outgoing 
# O(n) time complexity which can be represented as O(3n)
# The call using sorted function sorted(get_markts_outgoing) O(nlogn) complexity
# O(3n) + O(nlogn) --> O(3n + nlog(n) ) --> Θ(n log(n))
