TASK 4:
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing
telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts,
receive texts or receive incoming calls.

Print a message:

The list of numbers should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.

# Our above code with dictionay access is simple array data structure access and according to 
# https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/ & udacity lesson explain Big(O) we observe below
# The get_senders_num_list has, get_caller_receivers_num_list and get_markts_outgoing 
# O(n) time complexity which can be represented as O(3n)
# The call using sorted function sorted(get_markts_outgoing) O(nlogn) complexity
# O(3n) + O(nlogn) --> O(3n + nlog(n) ) --> Î˜(n log(n))
